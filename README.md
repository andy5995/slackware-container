# slackware-container

build scripts for a slackware container image

## Note

This repository was forked from
[vbatts/slackware-container](https://github.com/vbatts/slackware-container/)
at
[fork-point](https://github.com/andy5995/slackware-container/tree/fork-point).

## Overview

The Dockerfile is incomplete so far, since it expects a base image to be used.
It would be possible and understandable to use the 'busybox' image, and build
from there, but also to have a mkimage-slackware.sh to build the base image.

## build

Currently, using the installer bootstrap, the mkimage-slackware can create an
ultra-minimal slackware filesystem. (does not even include pkgtools)

If you have [podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod/tree/master/cmd/podman) installed (the is an [SBo build](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/system/podman/)):

```shell
CRT="sudo podman" make image
```

Then you will be able to run:

```shell
sudo podman run -i -t $USER/slackware-base /bin/sh
```

_(this also can be built and run with docker as well. If you build with one, you'll have to push your container build to a container registry before you can pull and run with the other)_

(This will be the environment to build out the Dockerfile from)
(( see http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/ for more info on that ))


To build alternate versions of slackware, pass gnu-make the RELEASE variable, like:

```shell
make image RELEASE=slackware64-13.37 IMG_NAME=$HOME/my_slackware:13.37
```

To build and test say slackware64-current in a docker container:

```shell
make run-current
```

## Index

This is this build process used to be the base of 'vbatts/slackware' on the
http://index.docker.io/

Just running:

```shell
sudo podman run -i -t vbatts/slackware /bin/sh
```

 or

```shell
sudo docker run -i -t vbatts/slackware /bin/sh
```

Will pull down this image for testing.
